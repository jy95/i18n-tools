# Installation

## Requirements {#requirements}

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed

:::tip Single installation

If not globally installed, Npx reinstalls the cli each time you run this command.  
Thus feel free to install it globally : `npm i -g @jy95/i18n-tools`  
(And not forgetting to update it when needed `npm update -g @jy95/i18n-tools` )
